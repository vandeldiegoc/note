Testing is generally classified into two main categories: functional testing and non-funtional testing. Functional testing specializes in evaluating the code's behavior and functionality. As the name implies, it focuses on testing the internal aspects of the program, encompassing unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and acceptance tests. These tests primarily verify how well the code functions within the system and may not consider external factors.

On the other hand, non-funtional testingvolves the assessment of external features. This category includes security testing, performance testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing. Manual testing tends to be more resource-intensive and often incurs higher costs, as it is performed by the QA team. These tests assess the software's interaction with external elements, ensuring its security, performance under various conditions, user-friendliness, and compatibility across different platforms.![[Types-of-software-testing-1.webp]]
