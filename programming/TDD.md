TDD (Test-Driven Development) is a software testing approach that prioritizes the construction of robust software through the implementation of key software concepts, such as the "first-test", "[[testing pyramid]]" "assert" pattern. TDD can be characterized in various ways, serving as a process, methodology, or even a pattern in software development. Its primary objective is to proactively address potential future issues in the code by establishing fundamental boundaries for the code's behavior. During the code-writing phase, TDD necessitates adhering to a predefined path to avoid deviations. Once the initial functionality is in place, the TDD process proceeds with the systematic refinement of both the test cases and the code itself, ensuring continuous maintenance and enhancement of the software.![[tdd-red-green-refactoring-v3.png]]
