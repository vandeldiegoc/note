The testing pyramid is a metaphorical representation of an approach to building and testing software, outlining the distribution of various test types to achieve comprehensive coverage. At its base, the pyramid emphasizes 'unit tests,' focusing on testing individual components. This layer comprises the majority of testing efforts due to its speed and cost-effectiveness.

The next layer is dedicated to 'integration testing,' where relationships between different components are examined to ensure their cohesive behavior. Integration testing validates how components interact with each other.

At the pinnacle of the pyramid lies 'end-to-end (E2E) testing.' This type of test closely mimics the real-world user experience, replicating the actual system behavior as users interact with it.

The testing pyramid encourages a testing strategy where the majority of efforts are invested in quick and cost-effective unit tests at the base, followed by integration tests to validate component interactions, and finally, E2E tests to verify the overall system behavior from the user's perspective. This distribution helps achieve an efficient and comprehensive testing approach.
