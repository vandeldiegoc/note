Ensuring the integrity of code is essential to minimize errors before software is deployed into production. Automated testing, in practice, involves creating additional software to test the original software. To develop high-quality code, it's advisable to follow the 'arrange, act, assert' pattern:

1. **Arrange:** Prepare the necessary conditions and data to execute the action you intend to test.
2. **Act:** Execute the action or operation you want to evaluate.
3. **Assert:** Verify that the outcomes of the action align with your expected results.
    
By adhering to this pattern, you can systematically design and execute tests to confirm that your code functions correctly.

There are two approaches to conducting tests: Manual Testing and Automation Testing. Manual Testing is typically performed by various experts such as developers, QA engineers, Product Managers, or Designers. It involves a thorough manual review of the application, examining its behavior in detail to identify any instances where it deviates from the expected functionality or overlooked details. On the contrary, Automation Testing utilizes tools and frameworks to create a test once, which can then be executed multiple times as needed. This type of testing is predominantly carried out by developers and QA engineers. However, it is worth noting that Automation Testing often requires more time compared to Manual Testing.
